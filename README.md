Dearing: "What is a technoassholisticmancer?"

ChatGPT: A "technoassholisticmancer" is not a real term. It is a word that has been made up by combining elements of various other words, such as "techno," "asshole," "holistic," and "necromancer." It is not clear what this made-up word might mean, because it is a jumble of unrelated words and concepts. It is possible that it could be used as a humorous or ironic way to describe someone or something that is technologically advanced, but also arrogant and manipulative. However, because the term is not a real word and has no established meaning, it is difficult to say for sure what it might imply or represent.

BTW: Don't stare too hard but there is a hidden message in the green boxes.
